                This is chess, except after move 6 you have the option to use your turn to arbitrarily connect
                two board squares instead of moving a piece. The board starts with horizontal (Dimension 1)
                and vertical (Dimension 2) connections already in place. You are free to add connections of
                dimensions from 1 to 5, as long as they don't land on a square that's in the sight of an opposing piece. 
                The visual layout of all of the squares on the screen does not matter, only the connections 
                between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no AI opponent - it's a hotseat game.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can move the pieces like normal by left-clicking and dragging.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can rearrange the board squares themselves by right-clicking and dragging them to a new location.
            </p>
            <p>
                To add a new connection after the 6th move, click on the button that says "Add Connection", 
                use the adjacent selector to choose a dimension, and then left-click a beginning and an end 
                square to create the connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                One major note though: Try to avoid making loops. The game doesn't like it very much.
